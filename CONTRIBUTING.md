# Contributing to ThoughtNet-Engine

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ThoughtNet-Engine as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow the existing code style (we use Prettier for formatting)
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for high test coverage

## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-username/ThoughtNet-Engine/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use cases and motivation
- Potential implementation approach (if you have ideas)
